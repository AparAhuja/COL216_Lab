README for Assignment-4: COL216

-------------------------------------------------------
Required code is present in the file main.cpp
-------------------------------------------------------
The document describing our approach, design and testing strategy is present in the file named Assignment4.pdf
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions for executing .cpp file from command line:

g++ main.cpp -o main

./main <FILE_NAME> <ROW_ACCESS_DELAY> <COL_ACCESS_DELAY> [<MODE>(0|1)]

Note: MODE is optional, default mode used is non-block memory access (1)
      Enter 0 to change the default mode and execute instructions in a block memory access fashion
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The test cases (60+ in total) that were used by us as a part of our extensive testing are all compiled together and placed in the TestCases folder.
Note: ROW_ACCESS_DELAY = 10, COL_ACCESS_DELAY = 2 in test cases, unless otherwise stated.
