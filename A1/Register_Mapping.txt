Integer Registers:

v0: used for making different syscalls, and also storing user inputs
a0: used in making syscalls (outputting strings and integers/double)

t0: Stores 'n', the total number of points
t1: Stores 'counter' (1 <= counter <= n + 1)


Floating Point Registers:

f0:  used for storing user input when syscalls are made
	 also stores currY (y2) while calculating area
f6:  the constant HALF (0.5)
f4:  value of area calculated till now
f8:  stores prevX (x1) while calculating area 
f10: stores prevY (y1) while calculating area
f12: stores currX (x1) while calculating area
	 also used in making syscalls and displaying area calculated on console
f14: stores the product y1 * y2 while calculating area
f16: stores x2 - x1 while calculating area
f18: stores either y1 + y2 or just y1^2, depending on location of points
f20: stores either |0.5 * (x2 - x1) * (y1 + y2)| or just y2^2 depending on location of points

(* used only when points are on opposite side of X-axis *)
f22: stores y1^2 + y2^2
f26: stores |0.5 * (x2 - x1) * (y1^2 + y2^2) / (y2 - y1)|
	 also used while comparing y1 * y2 with 0.0
f28: stores y2 - y1
