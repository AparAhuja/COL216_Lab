________OUTPUT________

cycle 1: Instruction - addi $t0 $t0 100: $t0 = 100
cycle 2: DRAM request issued(Store)
cycle 3-14: Instruction - sw $t0 100($zero): 
         DRAM Activity: Copy row 512 from memory to buffer.
                        Copy Data to column 100 from $zero.
                        Memory Address: 100 - 103 = 100
cycle 15: DRAM request issued(Load)
cycle 16-17: Instruction - lw $t1 0($t0): $t1 = 100
         DRAM Activity: Copy Data at column 512 to $t1.
                        Memory Address: 100 - 103 loaded
cycle 18: Instruction - addi $t1 $t1 1: $t1 = 101
